# hue-clip-api.node-red-flows

# ATTENTION! BE CAREFUL UPDATING YOUR BRIDGE! API CHANGES!

Version 4.3
---
HUE changed the Event-Flow output for groups in the API with a new Beta Firmware. I got the beta release 1.53.1953188010

Instead of sending payloads for every light/group seperately they changed it into a payload with one big array.
For the reason that the response data for the group is not always at the same position the array need to be split to single payloads first. 
Everything else seem to work like before.

Updated Flow V1:
https://github.com/andesse/hue-clip-api.node-red-flows/blob/main/HUE-CLIP-API_Node-Red-Flows.json

Array Splitter separately:
https://github.com/andesse/hue-clip-api.node-red-flows/blob/main/array_splitter.json

These changes can be done already, even when you dont have this Firmware. You can replace your nodes to be prepared before the public Firmware rollout. 
> Before you start to change everything, please run a quick test with one room.
>> BACKUP YOUR OLD FLOW BEFORE, TO AVOID DOUBLE EFFORT IF YOU HAVE AN ISSUE!

Here is a screenshot what is included and the new array payload in the debug window. Description:
The converter is set in between your event node (SSE or Yadomi) and the output is conected to the receivers. Double click the converters and add your discovered ID.

# Please read the whole readme before use!


This respository is an example flow how to communicate with https-request to the HUE-Bridge, using HUE's Restful API V2 (Clip API) 
It includes various sample flows, sub-flows, descriptions and a lot more. You won't be dependent on badly maintained contribs anymore. 

As using almost only built-in NodeRed nodes, this repository has nne dependence. It is Yadomi's contrib philipshue-events.

https://github.com/yadomi/node-red-contrib-philipshue-events

### Before importing this flow, it is important to install yadomi's contrib before

## DO NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT HAVING YADOMI CONTRIB INSTALLED!



### Installation Instructions:
- Install "@yadomi/node-red-contrib-philipshue-events" in NodeRed
- Import the Data from the :arrow_right: **HUE-CLIP-API_Node-Red-Flows.json** :arrow_left: into a new Flow Tab, deploy
- In the flow are labels with **step1-step7**, follow step-by-step
- **step1** generate a username for this flow in the Bridge, first add the Bridge IP in the labeled node, deploy
  Press the button on your Bridge. Inject the Request Node, the debug window will show the username
- **step2** Configure the hue-events node with your IP and just discovered username
- **step3** add the same data into the HEADER V2 node, deploy
- **step4** Inject the "Request all Data" node. This process will take a couple of seconds, the Data will be stored in context (memory)
- **step5** Now you can use the Inject nodes for different API Endpoints. The data will be shown in the debug window. Discover lights or rooms for the next step
- **step6** Double click on the blue "HUE Light Receiver" Node. Add the ID (for a light) or the RID (for a Room) inside the node, deploy
  Now use your App, turn on / off the light in the room, the subflow will output true/false. Repeat for all lights and rooms / zones.
  Do the same for motion sensors and buttons.
- **step7** In the flow are several examples how to send actions to the bridge. You can just try it out and see what happens. The description is the node name.
  Discover yor scenes, like in step5 and add a scene ID into the "Recall a Scene" Node, deploy. Use the inject to activate the scene, repeat for all scenes.
- You can start to build your setup.

### Recomendations:
- Do it room-by-room 
- Build the whole HUE-setup in a single Flow-Tab, use link-in / link-out nodes to connect it to your Rooms
- Label those link-in / link-out nodes, otherwise it will be too confusing
- Trigger scenes and not single lights, too much requests at one will be refused by the bridge
  The Bridge is just able to receive max! 5 light / 1 group request per second, less is better. If problems do occure, use the alternative request flow (step3)
- additional flows are in the "flows" folder in this repository and can be downloaded there
  
Colors get more complicated. These are x/y values now. To determine the right value I recommend to change the color in the app and watch the Event stream.
Open the color payload until you find the x/y values and use these.

If you need help, start a discussion, Thanks!

### And shoutout to everyone who participated with great ideas, code, and/or additional flows, that made this repository even better, Thank you! Credits below




Version 4.2 Update:
---
User Capusjon had the idea that it might be useful to add 3 Nodes for Enocean / Zigbee green power switches
>"Fluid Dimming when holding keypress" This is useful for switches like Enocean or zigbee green power devices that send a signal on push and >release. The first node send a request to dim up in 8000ms / second node dim down in 8000ms / third node to stop dimming.
>The nodes are set to the "light" endpoint and can be easily changed into "grouped_light", additional the ID is needed.

> new File:
> - /flows/dimming_nodes.json

- 3 nodes for dimming functionality for Enocean / Zigbee green power switches


Version 4.1 Update: (file has a V2 prefix)
---
User FredBlo supported this repository with a new approach to setup this flow concept. Credits to him for this release, thanks!

>If you have it already running with the initial release (up to v3.4), there is not much need to make these changes.
>This is not an replacement for the origial concept, it is a different concept with more parsing/code instead using change nodes.
>This new flow can be downloaded seperately

This will make it probably more easy to set it up initially. It also helps to have a cleaner looking Flow. There is one part of the Flow, that can be added seperately if you have an old setup. It is an error handling mechanism for the Bridge timeout, "Event_Sender". 


> new File:
> - V2_HUE-CLIP-API_Node-Red-Flows_Fred.Blo.json


- Existing Subflows (Light, Button & Motion Sensor receivers) are now 'configurable' for easier integration in existing system
- ID / RID is set in insert node config
- New subflow added 'Light Sender' to send commands to lamps easily, using node config :
- ID / RID is set in inserted node config
- type of light (light point or group of light)
- The 'bridge link' (receiver & sender) was revamped:
- single centralized grouped nodes for all calls
- handles 'overflows of calls' (i.e. when the HUE bridge refuses calls because it rate is > 5/sec, they are queued for repeat)
- a return value is sent to allow continuing the flow after command was sent
- Re-organized nodes in groups to make it easier reading / configuring / accessing
- Some comments are directly readable without opening them (i.e. double click on it)
- added output names to subflows to easily know what to expect as output when reading flow using such nodes (without having to open subflow)

- gradient_stripe.json change node added

- Rate limitation added to pro-actively avoid sending too many calls to HUE bridge
- Retry management : added a 'loop stopper' : when 10 retries failed, request fails, no more retries to avoid infinite loops creation
- Error management now manages the 429 error sent back by the bridge (with the 'real' new code the bridge sends back in case of exceeded calls)
- Some clean-up here and there

Version 3.4 Update:
--
Motion Sensor Behaviour Flow added, for Sensors that have no configuration. It will trigger Scenes, dim down, and turn off rooms.
Descriptions in the Flow labels.

Version 3.3 Update:
--
Alarm Flow added to flash a light red for 5 seconds. It will return to previous state.
README included in the Flow as usual. Have Fun!

Version 3.2 Update:
--
New File "SSE_Event_Stream.json"

This flow can replace the node from "@yadomi/node-red-contrib-philipshue-events"
First you need to Install the contrib "node-red-contrib-sse-client" before deploying this flow.
All other Informations are in the Labels of the Flow itself. (Double Click)

If you donâ€™t have any problems with yadomis contrib, there is no need to replace it.
You can still download this as a backup or try it out.


Version 3.1 Update:
--
This version comes with an upgraded "Helper Function Flow"
It let you easily discover:

- Room IDs / RIDs
- Zone IDs / RIDs
- Lamp IDs
- Motion Sensor IDs
- Button IDs

These are stored in context (default) until they are overwritten or erased.
With another Flow additional included, you can recall all these Informations as an array, or seperately.
